**SE SEM-IV Computer Engineering SPPU 2019 Pattern**
This repository contains laboratory resources, source codes, and assignment documents for Semester 4 of the Second Year (SE) Computer Engineering course at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), following the 2019 Pattern.

Repository Overview
The content covers practical assignments for Semester 4, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAL) and Microprocessor Laboratory (MPL).

Directory Structure
**1. SE (DSAL) LAB (Data Structures and Algorithms Lab)**
This directory contains C++ implementations of advanced data structures.

DSAL-CODES:

Source codes for Assignments 1 through 11 (Ass1.cpp to Ass11.cpp).

Includes rough work files for testing logic.

Resources:

DSA2 Lab Manual (PDF).

**2. SE (MP-ASM) LAB (Microprocessor Laboratory)**
This directory contains documentation and reports related to Assembly Language Programming and Microprocessor interfacing.

MPL CODES IN-OUT:

Assignment documents and output logs in PDF format (MP-ASS1 to MP-ASS11).

Resources:

MP Lab Manual (PDF).

Prerequisites and Tools
To utilize the resources in this repository, the following are recommended:

C++ Compiler (G++/GCC): For executing DSAL codes.

PDF Reader: To view Lab Manuals and Microprocessor assignment reports.

NASM/MASM (Optional): Required if you intend to write or run the actual Assembly code corresponding to the MP lab documents.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

For DSAL: Navigate to the DSAL-CODES folder and compile the .cpp files using a C++ compiler.

For MP-ASM: Navigate to the MPL CODES IN-OUT folder to review the assignment logic and outputs in the provided PDF files.

Disclaimer
These codes and documents are provided for educational and reference purposes to assist with understanding the SPPU 2019 Pattern syllabus. Students are encouraged to implement and test the logic independently.
